## Python Programming Practice

This repository contains Python programs and scripts that I wrote while learning Python in my university courses and from my own practice.  
Most of these programs cover the topics I studied during my 2nd and 3rd semesters.

---

## What’s Inside?

Here you’ll find programs related to important Python topics like:

- Basic Syntax and Data Types  
- Control Statements (`if`, `else`, `elif`, loops)  
- Functions (with and without return values)  
- Lists, Tuples, Sets  
- Simple Data Structures like Stack and Queue (using lists)  
- Using built-in functions like `map()`, `filter()`, `zip()`  
- File Input and Output  
- Error and Exception Handling (`try-except`)  
- Working with Dictionaries (basic key-value pairs)  
- Lambda Functions and List Comprehensions  

> **Note:** Advanced data structures like LinkedList, HashMap, HashSet are not included here yet.


## File Names & Structure

I named the files so that you can easily guess what each program is about:

- `basic_calculator.py` — Simple calculator program using control statements  
- `list_operations.py` — Examples working with lists and list methods  
- `stack_queue.py` — Implementation of stack and queue using lists  
- `file_read_write.py` — Reading from and writing to files in Python  
- `exception_handling.py` — Using try-except blocks for error handling  
- `lambda_map_filter.py` — Using lambda, map, filter, and zip functions  
- `dictionary_demo.py` — Basic dictionary usage examples

## How to Run
You can run these Python scripts using any IDE like PyCharm, VS Code.

## Why This Repository?
I created this repository mainly for myself to keep track of what I’ve learned and practiced in Python.
If you’re also learning Python, you’re welcome to use these codes, understand how things work, or improve them.

## About Me
I’m Nayem Uddin, a Computer Science and Engineering student currently in my 3rd semester.
I started learning Python in my 2nd semester, and this repo contains all my practice projects so far.

Thanks for stopping by and happy coding!
